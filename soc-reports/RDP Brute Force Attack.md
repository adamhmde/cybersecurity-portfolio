**Platform**: Letâ€™s Defend SOC Simulator  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Detection** Tool: Chronicle SIEM  
**Category**: Authentication / Remote Access

**Steps Taken:**

- Investigated authentication logs in Chronicle SIEM  
- Observed numerous failed logins using common usernames (e.g., admin, guest)
