**Report 2: Path Traversal Vulnerability**

**Title**: Directory Path Traversal on Check Point Security Gateway  
**Date**: May 30, 2025  
**Platform**: Let’s Defend SOC Simulator  
**Severity**: High  
**Detection** Tool: Chronicle SIEM  
**Category**: Injection / File Disclosure

**Steps Taken:**

- Reviewed query logs in Chronicle SIEM  
- Identified payloads attempting file access:  
  - ../../../../../etc/passwd  
  - ../../../../../etc/shadow  
- Scanned source IP  (203.160.68.12) in VirusTotal  
  - Flagged as malicious on VirusTotal  
  - GeoIP traced to Hong Kong

**Final Assessment:**

**True Positive**. The attacker attempted to exploit a directory traversal vulnerability to read sensitive system files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow) from the firewall appliance.

**Mitigation**:

- Block the attacker’s IP address and monitor for related IP ranges  
- Patch the vulnerable web service or WAF rule allowing traversal  
- Implement strict input validation and output encoding on file-access parameters  
- Limit web application access to sensitive files via least privilege  
- Conduct vulnerability scans to identify similar exposures
